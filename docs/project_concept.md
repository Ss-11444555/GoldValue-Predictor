# Project Concept Statement

## Title
GoldValue Predictor

## Problem Statement
Gold prices fluctuate daily due to market demand, currency values, and global events. Investors often struggle to anticipate these changes accurately. This project aims to develop a predictive model that forecasts future gold prices using historical data and key economic indicators.

## Objectives
- Collect and preprocess historical gold price and market indicator data.
- Build regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM) for price prediction.
- Evaluate models using RMSE and MAE metrics.
- Provide insights for financial decision-making and trend analysis.

## Proposed Approach
Data will be collected from online financial datasets (e.g., Yahoo Finance). After cleaning and feature engineering, multiple regression algorithms will be tested. The best-performing model will be deployed for continuous prediction and visualization.

## Expected Outcome
A model capable of predicting next-day gold prices with high accuracy and an interactive report/dashboard visualizing price trends.

## Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RÂ² Score
