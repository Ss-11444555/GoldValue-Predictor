**What was challenging?**  
Scheduling the task dependencies and choosing realistic durations was challenging because it required understanding how each phase of the project connects. Estimating how long data collection, preprocessing, and model training would take needed careful thinking, especially to avoid overlap and delays. Another challenge was coordinating with teammates to align our work schedules and ensure that tasks were not duplicated.

**How did GitHub \& Teams help?**  
GitHub was very useful for version control, allowing the team to store and update project files in one shared repository without overwriting each other’s work. It also helped track changes and maintain transparency in progress. Microsoft Teams, on the other hand, improved real-time collaboration and communication. It made it easy to share updates, upload files, and discuss feedback instantly. The combination of both tools ensured smooth teamwork and continuous progress tracking.

**What will you refine next week?**  
Next week, I plan to refine the project plan by adjusting task durations based on team feedback and aligning them more closely with our actual progress. I will also focus on improving the dataset preparation and starting the feature selection process for the GoldValue-Predictor model. Additionally, I aim to make the documentation more detailed to support upcoming implementation and evaluation phases.
