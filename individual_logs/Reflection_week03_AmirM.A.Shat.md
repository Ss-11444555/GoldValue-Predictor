What was challenging?
Coordinating task dependencies and estimating realistic timeframes for each activity was quite demanding.

How did GitHub \& Teams help?
GitHub supported version control and made it easier to share updates, while Teams facilitated communication and quick feedback among group members.

What will you refine next week?
I plan to fine-tune the project schedule and start organizing the datasets needed for training the model.
