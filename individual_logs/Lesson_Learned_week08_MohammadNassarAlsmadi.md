# Lessons Learned – Week 08 (GoldValue-Predictor)

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
The project schedule and work breakdown structure helped the most because they provided a clear reference for planned tasks and timelines. Comparing planned progress with actual progress made it easier to identify delays early.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
In future projects, I would allocate more buffer time for data-related tasks and improve early risk assessment. This would help reduce delays caused by unexpected data quality issues.
