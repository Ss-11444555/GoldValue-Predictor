1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, I actively participated in group discussions and helped in defining the project scope and objectives. I also contributed by reviewing our initial system design ideas and providing feedback on the feasibility of the proposed features. Additionally, I helped organize our shared workspace on GitHub and ensured all members had access and understood how to use it.

2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned how to use GitHub for team collaboration — especially committing, pushing, and managing files together.  
It also showed me the importance of clear task division and communication when multiple members work on the same project.

4. What will I focus on next week?
At first, I struggled with using Git commands in the Terminal and understanding how to connect my local files with GitHub.  
After some practice and guidance, I managed to set up everything correctly.  
Time coordination between teammates was also a bit challenging.
