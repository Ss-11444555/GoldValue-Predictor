# Week 04 – Individual Reflection
## Name: Mohammed  
## Project: GoldValue-Predictor – Machine Learning Model for Predicting Gold Prices

### 1. Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?

For this project, the **Data Acquisition & Cleaning** phase clearly contained the most detailed and time-consuming work. Even though it only has three main subtasks in the WBS, each of these tasks requires several smaller steps such as merging sources, fixing missing values, smoothing noisy data, and preparing feature engineering columns. This phase is crucial because the accuracy of gold price prediction is highly dependent on the quality of the historical dataset.

### 2. How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?

Breaking the project into subtasks helped me in several ways:

- **It revealed dependencies**  
  For example, I cannot start model training until the feature engineering pipeline is complete. The WBS makes these bottlenecks visible.

- **It clarified workload**  
  Seeing tasks itemized made it clear how much effort is needed each week.

- **It improved scheduling accuracy**  
  Instead of saying “do the model,” I have separate steps: training, evaluating, tuning, and selecting the best model.

- **It linked tasks to actual GitHub deliverables**  
  Each subtask corresponds to a real file or folder in the repository. This made progress measurable.

Overall, the WBS turned a big project into small actionable pieces.

### 3. What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?

Next week, I would adjust these items:

1. **Add extra buffer time to Model Evaluation**  
   Gold price data can behave unpredictably, so evaluating RMSE and tuning models may require more iterations.

2. **Start writing documentation earlier**  
   Instead of waiting until the end, I should document key decisions during development.

3. **Parallelize pipeline implementation with tuning**  
   I can start preparing the pipeline structure earlier while the model tuning is still ongoing.

These changes would reduce risk and make the upcoming weeks more efficient.
