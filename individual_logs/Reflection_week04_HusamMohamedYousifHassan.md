Week 04 Reflection
Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
In our breakdown, the Model Design & Training phase contained the largest number of subtasks. This is because it involved several technical activities such as algorithm selection, data preprocessing, running model trials, hyperparameter tuning, and generating saved model files, all of which contributed to a high level of granularity.

How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
Creating smaller subtasks helped me develop a clearer roadmap for the team. It improved time estimation, highlighted checkpoints between different tasks, and made role allocation easier. By mapping tasks to individual outcomes in our repository, it became much simpler to track progress and ensure no deliverables were overlooked.

What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
Going forward, I would revise the schedule by providing extra slack time around experimental tasks like training and evaluation, since they may require several iterations. I would also shift some subtasks earlier, such as documentation and front-end structuring, so they can be worked on in parallel rather than waiting for all model development to finish.
