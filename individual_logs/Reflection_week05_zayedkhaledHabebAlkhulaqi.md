Week 05 Reflection
1. Which phase has the highest cost and why?
The phase with the highest cost in my project is the model training phase because it uses the most computing resources, takes a long time to run experiments, and often requires large amounts of data, which increases both hardware and preparation costs.

2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?
I can reduce costs by using pre-trained models, limiting unnecessary training runs, and managing cloud resources carefully so that no compute time is wasted, allowing me to maintain the same performance while spending less.

3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and success?
Resource allocation affects my schedule because limited hardware or slow data preparation can delay progress, while proper allocation helps the project move smoothly, reduces risks of bottlenecks, and increases the chances of finishing on time with good results.
