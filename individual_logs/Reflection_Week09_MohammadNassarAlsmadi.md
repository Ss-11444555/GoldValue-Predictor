Identifying the critical path is important because it shows which activities
directly control the project completion time. Delays in these activities will
delay the entire project.

Model training posed the highest scheduling risk because it depends on earlier
tasks and may require additional time for tuning and experimentation.

Crashing a project can reduce completion time but usually increases cost and
resource usage. It may also reduce quality if tasks are rushed.
