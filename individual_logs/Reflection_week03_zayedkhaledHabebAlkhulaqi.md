How did GitHub & Teams help?
Using GitHub allowed everyone to manage changes efficiently, and Teams made collaboration smoother through better communication and feedback.

What will you refine next week?
Next week, Iâ€™ll focus on improving the accuracy of task timelines and getting the datasets ready for model development.
