What was challenging?
The main difficulty was managing how tasks depended on one another and ensuring the duration estimates were achievable.

How did GitHub \& Teams help?
Using GitHub allowed everyone to manage changes efficiently, and Teams made collaboration smoother through better communication and feedback.

What will you refine next week?
Next week, I’ll focus on improving the accuracy of task timelines and getting the datasets ready for model development.
