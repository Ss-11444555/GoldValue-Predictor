AI PROJECT MANAGEMENT 

1.	What did I contribute this week?
I have set up the initial repository structure on GitHub and created the project concept statement document.

2.	What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned how important it is to coordinate tasks (like who handles the GitHub folders versus the Miro diagram) using MS Teams/Slack so we don't duplicate work.

3.	What challenges did I face?
The main challenge was figuring out the exact technical approach for the AI model and making sure we all agreed on the best evaluation metrics before documenting them.

4.	What will I focus on next week?
I'm going to focus on starting the data collection for the project and defining the structure for the first Jupyter notebook in the /notebooks/ folder.
