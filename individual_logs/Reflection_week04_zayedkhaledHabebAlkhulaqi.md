# Week 04 Reflection
Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
In my WBS, the Model Design & Training phase had the most subtasks. It included choosing algorithms, preparing training data, experimenting with different models, tuning hyperparameters, and saving the trained models, so it naturally expanded into many small, detailed tasks.

How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
Breaking the work into smaller subtasks made it much clearer what actually needs to be done in each phase. It helped me estimate time more realistically, see dependencies between tasks, and assign work to team members in Planner/Excel and GitHub. This also ensured that every deliverable from the schedule has a matching task and output file in the repository.

What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
Next week, I would adjust the schedule by adding extra buffer time around the model-training and testing tasks, since they are more experimental and may take longer than expected. I would also reorder some subtasks so that documentation and dashboard design can start earlier in parallel, instead of waiting until all technical work is finished.
