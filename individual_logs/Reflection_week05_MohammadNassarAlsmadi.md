# Reflection – Week 05 (GoldValue-Predictor)

1. **Which project phase has the highest cost and why?**

The modelling and evaluation phase has the highest cost because it includes both GPU/compute resources and specialised work such as feature engineering and performance analysis.

2. **How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?**

I could reduce GPU hours by using smaller batches, fewer training epochs, or lighter models while still monitoring performance. I can also plan data cleaning and feature engineering more carefully to avoid rework. Using free tools and open-source libraries helps reduce software costs.

3. **How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?**

If resources are allocated correctly, each phase has enough time and support, which reduces delays and stress. Poor allocation (for example, too little time for data preparation) can cause errors, lower model accuracy, and force last-minute fixes, which affect both the schedule and the quality of the final system.
