1. What did I contribute this week?
I helped design the project workflow diagram showing our data flow, and I wrote the README files for the new /data/ and /docs/ folders.
2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned that good planning means clearly defining the project scope early on (in the Project Concept Statement) so everyone knows exactly what the AI system should do.
3. What challenges did I face?
I struggled a bit with getting the GitHub folder structure exactly right and ensuring I used meaningful commit messages for all the changes I made.
4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I plan to research the specific AI models we mentioned in the concept and look for references and external resources to add to our documentation.
