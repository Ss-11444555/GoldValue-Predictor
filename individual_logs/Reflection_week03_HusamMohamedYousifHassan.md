What was challenging?
It was tough to align task dependencies properly and assign timeframes that matched our actual capacity.

How did GitHub \& Teams help?
GitHub made tracking progress and sharing code easier, while Teams encouraged better teamwork and timely discussions.

What will you refine next week?
I intend to adjust the project scheduling further and work on organizing and cleaning the datasets for model training.
