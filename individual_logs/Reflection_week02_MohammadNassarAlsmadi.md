1. What did I contribute this week?
This week, I helped the team create the workflow diagram for our project using Miro. Additionally, I tested the GitHub repository setup to make sure everyone could push and pull updates correctly.

2. What did I learn about collaboration or planning?
I learned how version control helps a team avoid file conflicts and track progress more easily.  
Working together also made me realize how important it is to communicate frequently, especially when assigning tasks.
Planning the workflow together helped us divide our work efficiently.

3. What challenges did I face?
At first, I found it a bit confusing to understand how Git branches work.  
Sometimes my commits didn’t show up on GitHub because I forgot to pull before pushing.  
But after some practice, I became more comfortable with the commands and GitHub Desktop.

4. What will I focus on next week?
Next week, I will focus on preparing the data collection plan for our project.  
I also want to explore some tools we can use for data visualization and dashboard design.  
Finally, I’ll try to improve my understanding of how to manage branches properly in Git.
