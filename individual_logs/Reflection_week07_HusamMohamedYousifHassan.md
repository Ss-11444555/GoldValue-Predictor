# Reflection – Week 07 (GoldValue-Predictor)

### 1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?
Effective communication helps reduce risks by making sure everyone understands their responsibilities and deadlines. When information is shared clearly and on time, mistakes, delays, and misunderstandings are less likely to happen.

### 2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?
The project supervisor is the most critical stakeholder because they guide the project direction and provide feedback when problems appear. Regular communication with the supervisor helps ensure the project stays on the right path and meets academic expectations.
