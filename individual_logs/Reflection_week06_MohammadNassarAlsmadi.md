# Reflection – Week 06 (GoldValue-Predictor)

### 1. Which quality criterion do you think will be the hardest to achieve?
The hardest criterion will probably be achieving stable and accurate model performance. Gold price data can be unpredictable, so getting consistent MAE and RMSE values might require extra tuning.

### 2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?
The biggest risk is R2 – low model accuracy. If the model doesn’t perform well, the project loses its main purpose. It also affects several later tasks like visualization and reporting.

### 3. How does quality management support project success?
Quality management helps catch issues early before they grow into bigger problems. It keeps the project organized, ensures that each step meets a standard, and makes the final deliverables more reliable.
