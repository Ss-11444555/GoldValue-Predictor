# Lessons Learned – Week 08
Zayed Khaled

The planning activity that helped most in monitoring progress was creating a clear project schedule with defined milestones. This made it easier to compare planned and actual progress and quickly identify tasks that were falling behind. Regular progress tracking also helped highlight risks before they became critical.

In future projects, I would allocate more buffer time for technically complex tasks and improve early risk assessment. I would also increase communication frequency during integration phases to resolve issues faster and prevent schedule delays.
