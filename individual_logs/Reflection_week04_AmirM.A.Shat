Week 04 Reflection
Which phase of your project had the most subtasks?
The phase with the most subtasks in my WBS was the Model Design & Training stage. This section required selecting suitable algorithms, preparing and cleaning the dataset, running model experiments, tuning the performance parameters, and storing the final trained models. Because of these steps, it naturally contained many detailed subtasks.

How did breaking tasks down help you plan better?
Dividing the larger tasks into smaller subtasks helped me clearly see all required activities. It allowed me to estimate timelines more accurately, identify which tasks rely on others, and distribute roles more effectively within GitHub and Microsoft Planner. It also ensured every planned deliverable was linked to an actionable task in our project files.

What would you adjust in your project schedule next week?
For the upcoming week, I would adjust the schedule by allocating more time to model training and validation, since those processes depend on testing and can be unpredictable. I would also bring forward some documentation and UI-related work so that these can progress simultaneously instead of being postponed until the technical development is completed.
