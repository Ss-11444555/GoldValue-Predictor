Lessons Learned

The planning activity that helped the most was creating a clear project schedule and task breakdown. It made it easier to track progress and identify delays early.

In future projects, I would spend more time on data understanding and preprocessing during the planning phase. This would reduce delays later and improve overall project performance.
