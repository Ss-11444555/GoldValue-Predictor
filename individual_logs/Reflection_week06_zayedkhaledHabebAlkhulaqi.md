Week 06 Reflection
1. Which quality criterion will be hardest to achieve?
The hardest quality criterion for my project will likely be achieving consistent model accuracy because it depends heavily on the dataset size, cleanliness, and how well the model generalizes. Even small issues in data preparation or training can cause accuracy to drop, so maintaining a stable and reliable performance level throughout development will be challenging.

2. Which risk poses the greatest threat and why?
The risk that poses the greatest threat to my project is the possibility of exceeding cloud compute or training resource limits, because running out of GPU hours or budget directly delays model training and forces the team to reduce experiments, which affects both schedule and final performance.

3. How does quality management support project success?
Quality management supports the success of the project by making sure that every stage of development meets clear standards, which prevents errors from stacking up and keeps the final deliverables consistent, reliable, and aligned with the project goals, making it easier to stay on schedule and deliver a working system.
