# Reflection – Week 09 

Understanding project time management helped me realize how important task sequencing is in completing a project on time. By identifying dependencies, I learned that even small delays in early tasks can affect the entire schedule.

The activity that posed the highest risk was data preprocessing because it required multiple revisions and depended heavily on the quality of the dataset. Any delay in this task would directly impact model development.

Crashing the schedule was useful to shorten the project duration, but it also required additional effort and resources. This showed me that reducing time often comes with higher costs or increased workload.
