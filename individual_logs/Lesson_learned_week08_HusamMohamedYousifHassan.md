# Lessons Learned – Week 08 (GoldValue-Predictor)

### 1. What planning activity helped most in monitoring progress?
The cost and schedule planning done in the earlier weeks helped the most. Having a clear baseline made it easier to compare planned progress with actual progress and quickly see which tasks were falling behind.

### 2. What would you do differently in future projects?
In future projects, I would start data preparation earlier and assign more time to it from the beginning. I would also track progress more frequently to detect delays sooner and make adjustments before they affect the whole project.
