# Reflection – Week 07 (GoldValue-Predictor)

How does effective communication reduce project risks?

Effective communication helps reduce project risks by making sure everyone understands what needs to be done and when it should be completed. In the GoldValue-Predictor project, regular communication allows the team to identify problems such as data errors, model issues, or delays early. This makes it easier to solve problems before they affect the final outcome of the project



Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?

The most important stakeholder in this project is the project supervisor. The supervisor provides guidance, feedback, and direction throughout the project. Their advice helps ensure that the GoldValue-Predictor model meets academic requirements and follows proper AI project management practices.
