1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?

In a gold-price prediction project using regression and machine-learning models, the data collection and data preparation phase has the highest cost because financial datasets are often paid, require expert analysis, and demand substantial time to clean, merge, and preprocess; this phase also involves large storage needs and computing resources, making it the most resource-intensive part of the project.

2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?

You can reduce costs without lowering quality by using free and reliable financial data sources, minimizing cloud computing time, applying feature selection to remove unnecessary variables, choosing efficient models before using heavier ones, and reusing open-source tools or prebuilt models so the project still delivers accurate predictions at a lower operational cost.

3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?

Resource allocation influences the project by determining how fast data is prepared, how smoothly models are trained, and how accurate the final predictions will be; when data engineers, data scientists, and computing resources are properly assigned, the project stays on schedule and produces strong results, but poor allocation leads to delays, weak model performance, and reduced overall success.
