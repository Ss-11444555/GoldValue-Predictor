# Reflection – Week 09 (Gold Price Prediction Project)

This lab helped me understand how the critical path determines the minimum time required to complete a project. Identifying critical activities made it clear which tasks must be carefully monitored to avoid delays.

Model training was the most time-sensitive activity because it required testing different configurations and depended on previous tasks being completed correctly. Any issues during this stage could extend the project timeline.

Although crashing reduced the overall duration, it increased pressure on the team and resources. This lab taught me that project managers must balance time, cost, and quality when making scheduling decisions.
