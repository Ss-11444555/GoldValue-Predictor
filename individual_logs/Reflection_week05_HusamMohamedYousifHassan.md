# Reflection – Week 05 (GoldValue-Predictor)

1. Which project phase has the highest cost and why?

The modelling phase has the highest cost because it requires both GPU hours and more specialized work like feature engineering and evaluation. These tasks take longer and rely on technical resources.

2. How could you reduce costs without affecting quality?

I can reduce costs by lowering GPU usage, optimizing the training process, and planning tasks better to avoid rework. Using free tools and keeping the dataset manageable also helps.

3. How does resource allocation influence your schedule and overall success?

Good resource allocation keeps the project on track and prevents delays. If time or resources are not assigned correctly, the project slows down and becomes more expensive. Proper planning makes the work smoother and improves the final result.
