# Reflection – Week 07 (Zayed Khaled)

## 1) How does effective communication reduce project risks?
Effective communication reduces risks by preventing misunderstandings about scope, requirements, and deadlines. Regular updates reveal issues early (e.g., technical blockers or resource constraints), so the team can respond before delays become serious. Clear documentation and written approvals also reduce scope creep and avoid rework, improving quality and stakeholder satisfaction.

## 2) Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?
The most critical stakeholder is the Lecturer/Supervisor (and/or Sponsor/Client) because they define success criteria and approve major decisions. Their feedback directly affects project scope, priorities, and evaluation. If their expectations are unclear or not met, the project can fail even if the system works technically.
