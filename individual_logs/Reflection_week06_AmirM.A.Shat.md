1. Which quality criterion do you think will be hardest to achieve?

The hardest quality criterion to achieve in this project is high prediction accuracy, because financial markets are influenced by many unpredictable factors such as global events, economic shifts, investor sentiment, and geopolitical instability, making it difficult for regression or machine-learning models to capture sudden changes and produce consistently reliable forecasts.

2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?

The greatest risk to the project is poor or insufficient data quality, because machine-learning models depend heavily on accurate, complete, and up-to-date financial data; if the dataset contains missing values, errors, outdated information, or inconsistent formats, the model’s predictions will be weak, leading to unreliable forecasting results.

3. How does quality management support project success?

Quality management supports project success by ensuring that the data used is accurate, the models are properly validated, and the project follows consistent standards for testing and evaluation; this reduces errors, improves prediction reliability, and ensures that the final forecasting system meets user expectations and performs well under real financial conditions.
