# Reflection – Week 09 

Working on project scheduling improved my understanding of how planning affects execution. Creating the Gantt chart and identifying dependencies helped me visualize how tasks flow throughout the project lifecycle.

Testing and validation presented the highest scheduling risk because it required revisiting earlier steps if errors were found. This reinforced the importance of completing earlier tasks carefully.

Crashing the schedule demonstrated that shortening project duration is possible, but it may lead to increased workload and potential quality risks. Proper planning is essential to minimize the need for schedule compression.
