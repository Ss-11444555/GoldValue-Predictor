# Reflection – Week 06 (GoldValue-Predictor)

### 1. Which quality criterion do you think will be the hardest to achieve?
The hardest quality criterion for this project will be keeping the model’s error values (MAE and RMSE) consistently low. Since gold prices fluctuate a lot, getting stable and accurate predictions may require extra tuning and testing.

### 2. Which risk poses the greatest threat to your project and why?
The risk that concerns me the most is exceeding the GPU hours during model training. If training takes longer than expected, the cost can increase quickly and affect the rest of the project timeline and budget.

### 3. How does quality management support project success?
Quality management helps ensure that every part of the project meets the required standards. It encourages me to check the data, the model results, and the documentation more carefully. This reduces mistakes, keeps the schedule on track, and improves the reliability of the final deliverables.
