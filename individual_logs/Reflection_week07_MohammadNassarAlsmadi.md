### 1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?
Effective communication helps reduce misunderstandings and delays. When stakeholders are updated regularly, problems can be identified early and resolved before they affect the project timeline or quality.

### 2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?
The course lecturer is the most critical stakeholder because they evaluate the project and ensure it meets academic requirements. Clear communication helps align the project with grading expectations.
