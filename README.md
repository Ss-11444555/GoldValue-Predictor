## Project Management Approach

This project was managed using standard **project management principles** to ensure structured planning, execution, monitoring, and delivery.

The project lifecycle followed a phased approach aligned with academic project management practices.

---

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Data collection using real-time financial sources
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and regression modeling
- Model evaluation and visualization
- Development of an interactive prediction interface
- Documentation and reporting

### Out of Scope
- High-frequency trading systems
- Real-time automated trading execution
- Deployment to cloud production environments

---

## Project Planning

Project planning activities included:

- Defining project objectives and success criteria
- Identifying required tools, libraries, and data sources
- Structuring the repository into logical project management folders
- Creating a development timeline with milestones

Planning documents are stored in the `planning/` and `schedule/` directories.

---

## Schedule and Milestones

The project was divided into weekly milestones:

1. Project initiation and scope definition  
2. Data collection and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory data analysis  
4. Feature engineering  
5. Model training and evaluation  
6. User interface design  
7. Final documentation and reporting  

Scheduling artifacts such as work breakdown structures (WBS), timelines, and task tracking are stored in the `schedule/` folder.

## Risk Management

Potential project risks were identified and managed throughout the project:

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----|---------------------|
| Data availability issues | Use of reliable real-time data source (Yahoo Finance) |
| Data quality problems | Data cleaning and validation steps |
| Model overfitting | Train-test split and evaluation metrics |
| Scope creep | Clearly defined project scope |
| Time constraints | Weekly milestones and progress monitoring |

Risk-related documents are maintained in the `monitoring/` folder.

---

## Quality Management

Quality assurance was maintained through:

- Code readability and modular design
- Data validation and consistency checks
- Model performance evaluation using RMSE and R²
- Visualization to verify model behavior

Quality-related documents are stored in the `quality/` directory.

---

## Monitoring and Control

Project progress was continuously monitored by:

- Tracking completed tasks against planned milestones
- Version control using Git and GitHub
- Regular commits to document progress and changes

Monitoring and control artifacts are maintained in the `monitoring/` directory.

---

## Stakeholder and Communication Management

Key stakeholders included:
- Course instructor / project supervisor
- Project evaluator

Communication planning and stakeholder documentation are stored in the `stakeholders/` and `communication/` directories.

---

## Project Deliverables

The main deliverables of the project include:

- Clean and documented Jupyter notebooks
- Machine learning regression model
- Interactive gold price prediction interface
- Project management documentation
- Final project report

Deliverables are archived in the `reports/` directory.
