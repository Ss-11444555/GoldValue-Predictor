\# Quality Definition (Week 06) – GoldValue-Predictor



\- \*\*Accuracy target:\*\* Model should achieve acceptable error metrics such as MAE < 2 and RMSE within a reasonable range based on historical gold price fluctuations.

\- \*\*Performance expectations:\*\* Model should run inference in under 2 seconds and training should not exceed allocated GPU hours.

\- \*\*User interface/usability expectations:\*\* Visualizations must be clear, readable, and plotted correctly. No missing labels or broken graphs.

\- \*\*Data quality requirements:\*\* Dataset must be cleaned, no missing values, correct date formatting, and consistent price values.

\## Integration Notes



\- Quality checks will occur after Task 2.2 (Data Cleaning) and Task 3.2 (Model Evaluation).

\- Additional verification added before final report writing.

\- Schedule adjusted to include two review cycles in Phase 2 and Phase 3.
