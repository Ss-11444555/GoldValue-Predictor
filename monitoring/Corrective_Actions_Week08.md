# Corrective Actions – Week 08
Project: GoldValue-Predictor

## Proposed Corrective Actions

### 1. Resource Reallocation
Additional time will be allocated to data cleaning and feature engineering by reducing time spent on non-critical documentation tasks. This helps recover delays without increasing overall project duration.

### 2. Schedule Adjustment
The schedule for model evaluation will be slightly extended to allow more time for improved data preparation. This adjustment ensures better model performance without affecting the final submission deadline.
