| Model Evaluation | 40 | 35 | Slightly behind |
| Documentation & Reporting | 30 | 25 | Behind |

## Performance Analysis

The tasks with the largest deviation from the plan are data cleaning and feature engineering. These tasks took longer than expected due to data inconsistencies and the need for repeated preprocessing. The delays are mainly related to resource and time estimation issues rather than scope changes. Some risks identified earlier, such as dataset quality problems, directly contributed to these delays.
